            The concept of ShareGarden is to connect communities to healthy food alternatives.
            User's can choose to share their garden spaces (if they have a surplus of produce) or they can look for gardens to pick up produce from. Communal contributions help those who need it the most. Share Garden is a non-profit organization; however, donations and contributions are required for those seeking a garden.

Have an excess of produce? This option is for owners of gardens, green spaces, and farm 
land that want to contribute their extra produce to a good cause.
