The concept of ShareGarden is to connect communities to healthy food alternatives.
User's can choose to share their garden spaces (if they have a surplus of produce) or they can look for gardens to pick up produce from.
Communal contributions help those who need it the most. 
Share Garden is a non-profit organization; however, donations and contributions are required for those seeking a garden.
